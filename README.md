# ChatApp
A Simple TCP Chatroom Application

<h1>Usage</h1>

Ensure python is installed and all neccesary pip modules are also installed (only if running from client.py) - recommend you run from the exe release

```
1) Host servers on your public ip address, port 50000 (port changing may come soon)
2) Join servers with that IP once they have hosted and port forwarded 50000 
Disclaimer: (port forwading is neccessary for more than localhost connections)
